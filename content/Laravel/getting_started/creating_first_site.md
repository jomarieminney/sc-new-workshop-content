#### Creating Your First Site
Now we have our local development environment ready to go, let's create our first site!

 - Search for 'Herd' in Spotlight or Finder, and open the application.
 - Click the **Let's Get Started** button. If this is the first time you have opened Herd, a bunch of things will likely install in the background. Accept any prompts until setup is complete.
 - Open the Herd Dashboard once setup has completed.
 
 **Important Note:**  
 If prompted to enter a license key for Herd Pro, choose **Skip for now**. You do not need Herd Pro!

{{% tab title="_**Linux**_" %}}
The best way to create a new application on a Linux machine is from the command line.

In your terminal of choice, run `laravel new my-app`.

After creating your Laravel application, you only need to install its frontend dependencies via NPM and start the Laravel development server:

```
cd my-app
npm install && npm run build
composer run dev
```

You should now have a home page that looks like this - if not don't worry, we'll troubleshoot in the next step!
