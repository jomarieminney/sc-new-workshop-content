Welcome to the Laravel Win Wall tutorial! We're going to build a web application called **Win Wall** - a virtual version of a She Codes tradition where we celebrate the little wins we've experienced by sharing them on sticky notes.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Have set up a Laravel development environment
- Have created user authentication (registration and login)
- Have built interactive functionality for posting sticky notes
- Have applied your own custom styles to your application
- Understand the basics of Laravel's architecture
- Understand how databases work with Laravel

### Prerequisites

Before we start, you'll need:

- A computer with internet access
- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS (helpful but not required)
- Willingness to learn and experiment!

### Let's Get Started!

Laravel is a coding framework built on the PHP programming language. In order to preview the application we are going to build and test our code, we need to have a local development environment set up that will act as a server (the thing that 'serves' our application to users on the internet). You don't need to understand too much about this just yet - but if you are interested in learning more about how the internet works, check out [this explanation](/django/how_the_internet_works/?target=_blank) in our Django tutorial.

Laravel has its own desktop application that is optimised for Laravel development, called Laravel Herd. Our first step will be to install Herd to set up our own local development environment.
