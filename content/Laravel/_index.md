Welcome to our She Codes Australia Laravel tutorial! 

This tutorial teaches you the basics of getting your own web application up and running, complete with authentication (the ability to register and log in) and interactive functionality (like posting a new sticky note!).

We'll be building an application called Win Wall - a virtual version of a She Codes tradition where we celebrate the little wins we've experienced by sharing them on sticky notes.

A preview of the end result is below:
