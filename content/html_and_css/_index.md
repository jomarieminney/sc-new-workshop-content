Everything you see when you're navigating around the Internet - from fonts and colours, to dropdown menus and sliders - is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript being controlled by your computer's browser.

This tutorial covers the basics of HTML & CSS with minimal setup required. Dive straight in!

For this course we’ll be writing our code on Codepen, which is an online code editing tool. This allows us to write HTML and CSS without needing to install anything on your computer as we'll do it all in a web browser.

Before you start writing any code, [head over to CodePen](https://codepen.io) and sign up for a free account.
