What is Python?

Python is a very popular programming
 language that can be used for creating websites, games, scientific software,
 graphics, and much, much more.

Python originated in the late 1980s and its main goal is to be readable by
 human beings (not only machines!). This is why it looks much simpler than
 other programming languages. This makes it easy to learn, but don't worry
 – Python is also really powerful!
